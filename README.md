## About Me ✨
Im Elise, a junior at Georgia State University working on a degree in computer information systems with a double concentration in Cybersecurity and Data Analytics.

My passion lies in turning complex data into clear, actionable insights that support smarter decisions and strengthen security. With a strong foundation in statistics, I can analyze datasets in depth, uncover patterns, and identify trends or anomalies that might otherwise go unnoticed.
