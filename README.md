## About Me âœ¨
Im Elise, a junior at Georgia State University working on a degree in computer information systems with a concentration in data analytics.

My passion lies in transforming complicated data into something more insightful that can be used to inform decisions and spark creativity. Because of my passion for statistics, I am able to examine data sets in great detail and find patterns and trends that might otherwise go overlooked.
